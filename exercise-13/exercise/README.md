### Tasks

All work needs to be done in the `exercise-13` folder. (It may be named `exercise-13-master`.)

Other than correcting any validation errors, you **MAY NOT** change any of the HTML.

There is a corresponding example for each set of html/css files in this repository. Look at how the page is laid out and mimic this. Be sure to look at each HTML file to see what elements/ids you can use to apply these styles.

In all cases, your layout should be flexible! Be sure to use the correct properties and values to achieve this. Pay attention to detail -- such as whitespace (you will need to adjust box model properties in a couple cases) and content constraint (you will need to center each `#wrapper` within body).

### 01-two-columns

Apply a two column grid with each column being of equal width. Apply a 20px grid gap. Keep the entire layout constrained within 960px. Adjust whitespace for the remaining content using box model properties.

### 02-three-columns

Apply a three-column grid with the middle column double the width of the two outer columns. Apply a 15px grid gap. Keep the entire layout constrained within 800px. Adjust whitespace for the remaining content using box model properties.

### 03-layout-a

Set the header, nav and footer to have a background color of `#eee`. Keep the entire layout constrained within 960px. Use only grid numbers to lay out the elements. The header and footer should stretch across the width of the container. The nav will take up 1/3 of the container; the main 2/3. Apply a 20px grid gap. Adjust whitespace for the remaining content using box model properties.

### 04-layout-b

- Set the header, nav and footer to have a background color of `#eee`. Keep the entire layout constrained within 960px. Use grid numbers to lay out header, nav, main and footer. The nav will take up 1/3 of the container; the main 2/3. Use a grid template to lay out the sections within main. The 'welcome' section will stretch the width of main; the remaining two will split the width of main equally. Apply a 20px grid gap on all grids. Adjust whitespace for the remaining content using box model properties.

### 05-layout-c

Lots to complete in this one!

- Create a horizontal navigation. You do not necessarily need to use a grid here (there is an demonstration provided in the `examples/11-extras` repository), but you can! The spacing between each item doesn't need to be exact, but there should be spacing.

- Set the header, nav and footer to have a background color of `#eee`. Set the section(s) to have a  background of `transparent` (this will overwrite the rule set in `base.css`). Keep the entire layout constrained within 800px. Use only a grid template to lay out the elements. (Do you have to use a grid on `#wrapper`? Or is there another, simpler way to accomplish this layout? Hint, hint.)


### How to tackle this project

Decide what you need to do, one step at a time.

Write down each task as you go. When you complete it, check it off. Decide on the next task to tackle.

Once you get into marking up content within the body, it is okay if you get stuck. Set aside that task and move on to another. Note the item you struggled with (so you can spend time on it later) and keep moving forward.

### Am I done?

Again, it is not expected for you to complete this exercise in class. If you finish, have your professor give it a look. If you are finished, re-download the repository files and go through the fixes again. Practice, repetition is an excellent way to learn.

### Why isn't X working?

Before asking for help, try working through the problem first. Refer to your notes, book or any resources made available to you for this course.

When something does not appear to work as you expect, ask yourself:

- Did I forget to close a tag?
- Are there typos in element, attribute, value names?
- Did I forget to include quotes around attributes?
- Are my file names, directory paths correct?
- Does my code validate?
- Are there typos in my file name?
- Is the file in the correct directory?
- Is my style sheet properly linked?
- Are my selectors correct?
- Do my properties exist? Are there typos?
- Does the property accept the value I am giving it?
- Is all my CSS punctuation there?

Remember, you can always refer to your notes, book or any resources made available to you for this course.

**Good luck!**
